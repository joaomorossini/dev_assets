AfricaCare is a for-profit company that provides healthcare services to over 16 thousand workers in Angola, all employed by 'Grupo Castel', who produce a range of products including beer, soft drinks and energy drinks.

Part of the scope of the company is to promote health related talks and events for the workers and their families. A program has been developed for this year, with pre defined subjects and dates for each subject. However, it needs to be improved to be more engaging and effective.

<current_program>
Each planned talk is described in the excel file '2_personal/africa_care/reference_material/calendario_palestras.md'. Each PDF in the folder '2_personal/africa_care/reference_material contains the detail for one planned talk.
</current_program>

<goal>
Our current goal is to re-design the program to be more engaging and effective by proposing new and more interesting subjects, that are more relevant to the workers, but also that are more appealing to the public to attend willingly.
</goal>

<tasks>
1. Start by reviewing the current program in the Excel file
2. Then, review the PDF files in the folder '2_personal/africa_care/reference_material'
3. Generate new subjects for 10 talks (from March through December)

    - Objectivos específicos
    - Conteúdos programáticos
    - Indicações metodológicas
    - Auxiliares didácticos
5. Generate a new Excel file with the new subjects
