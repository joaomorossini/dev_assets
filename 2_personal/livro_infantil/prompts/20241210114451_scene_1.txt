```Scene 1: Livinha encontra a chave dourada.
In a whimsical, colorful, children's fantasy storybook style like 'The Gruffalo' and 'The Snail and the Whale', illustrate a vibrant forest clearing. The scene is bathed in dappled sunlight filtering through the dense canopy of tall, ancient trees with textured bark and lush green leaves. In the center, a small clearing with soft, mossy ground surrounded by a variety of colorful, oversized flowers in bloom. To the right, a large, gnarled tree trunk with a hollow at its base, partially covered in ivy and mushrooms. Emerging from the hollow is a small, curious girl named Livinha. She has curly brown hair, tied with a bright red ribbon, wearing a simple blue dress and yellow shoes. Livinha's expression is one of wonder and excitement as she holds up a shiny, golden key. The key is ornate, with intricate designs and sparkling in the sunlight. Around her, small woodland creatures like rabbits, birds, and butterflies watch her with interest. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves and flowers, adding a sense of movement to the scene. In the background, hints of winding forest paths and distant trees create depth and invite exploration.```
